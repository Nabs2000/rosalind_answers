# Intro to Molecular Biology: The Cell

- The **cell** is the building block of life
- The **nucleus** (a component of most eukaryotic cells) is the hub of cellular activity in a cell
- The nucleus contains macromolecules called **chromatin**
  - Chromatin are nucleic acids (like DNA) and proteins found in the nucleus
  - These structures gather into larger ones called **chromosomes**. Steps:
    1. First, DNA wraps around proteins called histones to form _nucleosomes_
    2. Then, these new structures continue to couil and pack themselves into more complex structures, until the well-known "X-shape" forms during metaphase
- **Nucleic acids** are composed of three things:
  1. Sugar
  2. Phosphate ion
  3. Nucleobase
- Nucleic acids always contain the same sugar and phosphate molecules, and differ only in their choice of base
  - So, the ordering of bases defines a nucleic acid's _primary structure_
