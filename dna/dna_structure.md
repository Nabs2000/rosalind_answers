# The Secondary and Tertiary Structures of DNA

- The sequence of nucleic acids (their primary structure) tell us nothing about their 3-D structure
- Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling's high resolution X-ray image of DNA led to Watson and Crick's double helix model
- They proposed the following:

  1. DNA is made up of two strands running in opposite directions
  2. Each base bonds to a base in the opposite strand
  3. The two strands are twisted together into a long spiral staircase called a **double helix**

- The units of DNA are in bp (base pairs)
- If we know one strand, we can deduce the other, and we know it will run in the opposite direction
