# RNA: The Second Nucleic Acid

- **RNA** is another nucleic acid which contains **uracil** instead of thymine and **ribose** instead of deoxyribose
- DNA is used as a template for constructing a strand of RNA (RNA transcription). This RNA is called **messenger RNA** or **mRNA**
- DNA typically remains in the nucleus; RNA can enter the far reaches of the cell to carry out DNA's instructions
