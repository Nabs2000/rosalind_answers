# The Fibonacci Sequence

- Created by Fibonacci in the 13th century when making a statement about rabbits mating
- A **sequence** is an ordered collection of objects which are allowed to repeat

  - Can be finite or infinite

- A **recurrence relation** is a way of defining the terms of a sequence with respect to the values of previous terms

  - In the case of the rabbits, the number of rabbits alive in the current month is equal to the number alive in the previous month plus any new offspring
  - The number of offspring is equal to the number of rabbits alive two months prior
  - So, the recurrence relation becomes
    $F_n = F_{n+1} + F_{n+2}$
